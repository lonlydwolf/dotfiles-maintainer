MCP Server: DotfilesMaintainer with Semantic Memory

This server provides an AI agent with persistent, semantic memory for managing
dotfiles across multiple machines. Instead of treating config files as static
text, it maintains a rich semantic graph of:

- WHY changes were made (rationale, context, trade-offs)
- WHAT problems were solved (troubleshooting history)
- WHAT's planned for the future (roadmap, trials)
- HOW performance is impacted (benchmarks, hardware-aware decisions)
- WHERE configurations live across machines (sync state, drift detection)
